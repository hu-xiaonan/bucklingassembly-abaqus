# Disturbance data file
#
# This file defines the disturbance locations and orientations.
#
# Each line specifies a disturbance point.
#
# Disturbance format:
#
#   {X} {Y} {DEFLECTION}
#
#   where (X, Y) is the coordinate of disturbance location, and DEFLECTION is
#   the normalized out-of-plane displacement at that point. Use 0, 1, or -1
#   for DEFLECTION; do not enter actual displacement values. The program will
#   automatically scale the disturbance according to the shell thickness.

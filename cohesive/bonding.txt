# Bonding regions data file
#
# This file defines the regions used for bonding.
#
# Supported bonding shapes: circular and rectangular.
#
# Circular bonding format:
#
#   CIRCLE {XC} {YC} {R}
#
#   where XC, YC is the center coordinate of the circle and R is the radius.
#
# Rectangular bonding format:
#
#   RECT {X1} {Y1} {X2} {Y2}
#
#   where (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are the coordinates of the opposite corners of
#   the rectangle.
